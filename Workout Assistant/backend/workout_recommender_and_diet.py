ASSIGNMENT:
Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Create a list of suggestions to improve the overall healthiness of the meal. If a meal is balanced (e.g., includes a variety of vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats), and the caloric content aligns with healthy eating goals, output "Good meal, no suggestions" for that meal.
2 - Calculate the number of calories and nutritional values (total fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrate, protein) from the user's meal, breaking down each component individually.
3 - Rate the User's diet on a scale from 1 - 10
4 - Output a json object that contains the following keys: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and rating.

When creating a list of suggestions, first critique the meal yourself, think about constructive feedback on what could be improved, and THEN suggest healthier alternatives or adjustments to align with the User's Goal.
Consider the following in your analysis:
- Nutrient density (vitamins, minerals, fiber, etc.)
- Balance between macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats)
- Preparation methods (grilled vs. fried, etc.)
- Incorporation of whole foods vs. processed foods
- Portion control
- Personalize suggestions based on the User's Age, Sex, Weight, Height, and Goal.

When suggesting alternatives, ensure that they are practical, easy to implement, and tasty.
Offer tips on cooking methods, ingredient substitutions, and any other advice that would help the user transition to healthier eating habits.
Use the list of different types of diet plans to influence the output, but don't mention the diet plans explicitly. Keep in mind the risks of each diet plan with the user's age & sex when forming the output.

**IMPORTANT: Ensure the suggestions directly reflect the meal descriptions given. Do not mention ingredients or foods not listed in the meal descriptions.

If a meal is balanced (e.g., includes a variety of vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats), and the caloric content aligns with healthy eating goals, output "Good meal, no suggestions" for that meal.

For calorie calculation:
- Estimate the caloric content for each meal component separately, and sum them for a total caloric value.
- Use established nutritional databases or algorithms to ensure accuracy. Be transparent about any limitations or uncertainties in calorie estimates.
- Clearly state the total number of calories for each meal and provide a daily total.

**IMPORTANT: Ensure the output is in json format

Use the following format for the output:
breakfast:
- Suggestion: <List of Suggestions to Improve formatted as a list>
- Calories: <The number of calories as an integer>
- Nutrition: <total fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrate, protein as integers>
lunch:
